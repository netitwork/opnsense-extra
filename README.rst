* convert_opnsense_openvpn_config.py

  With the configuration switch in OPNsense from OpenVPN servers to instances,
  migrating large installations with many OpenVPN configurations is a larger
  task. This script converts any servers by replacing the configuration in the
  configuration XML file for re-upload.
